# Stock Market API Bridge Service

An API bridge service intended to be used to both download and serve stock market data.<br>

The concept behind this project is to create a personal API that maintains a consistent API contract<br>
between itself and other consuming projects despite possibly fetching the data from different APIs.<br>
